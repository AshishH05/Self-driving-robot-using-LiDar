# Self-driving-robot-using-LiDar

// This project is a LiDAR-based Self-Driving Car that can navigate an obstacle course guided by a line using Raspberry Pi.

// Implemented in C and C++

// LiDAR is used to detect the obstacles and successfully navigate around them.

// Used threads in Linux for all the sensors to make real-time decisions.

// Wrote our own libraries using C and C++ for the car to make sharp and slight turns and to avoid obstacles.

// Video for the working project can be found here -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYSw9-s8noM

// The references used for the the RPLidar are given here - http://www.slamtec.com/en/Support#rplidar-a-series

// For the Lidar code I have made changes in the file /sdk/app/ultra_simple/main.cpp 

//This file writes to a fifo created by testingpipe.c and testingpipe.c reads from this fifo
